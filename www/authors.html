</P>
<UL><LI>If you use PHISH for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. 

<LI>If you encounter a bug or have a question about using the software,
send us an email. 

<LI>If you write a paper using the PHISH library, we can post a citation
to it on <A HREF = "papers.html">this page</A>. 

<LI>If you write a program (minnow) which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution.  Ditto for a PHISH input script that performs an
interesting calculation.  

<LI>If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases.
