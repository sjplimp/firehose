<H4><A NAME = "version"></A>What version of the PHISH library do you have? 
</H4>
<P>A PHISH "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Nov
2012.  PHISH is updated continuously.  Every time we fix a bug or add
a feature, we release it immediately, as listed below.  Each dated
copy of PHISH contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and
including that version date.  Each time you use the
<A HREF = "doc/Section_bait.html">bait.py</A> tool, the version date is printed to
the screen.  It is also in the file bait/version.py and in the PHISH
directory name created when you unpack a tarball.
</P>

always describe the most current version of PHISH.
