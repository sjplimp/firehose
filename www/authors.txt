You can send us email regarding any of these issues:

If you use PHISH for something interesting, we'd like to hear about
it. :ulb,l

If you encounter a bug or have a question about using the software,
send us an email. :l

If you write a paper using the PHISH library, we can post a citation
to it on "this page"_papers.html. :l

If you write a program (minnow) which calls the library, that others
would be interested in, you can send it and we'll include it in the
distribution.  Ditto for a PHISH input script that performs an
interesting calculation.  :l

If you enhance the library itself or have ideas for doing so, we can
discuss including the improvements in future releases. :l,ule
